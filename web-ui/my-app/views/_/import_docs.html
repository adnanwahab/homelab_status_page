Sure! Below is an HTML component using Tailwind CSS to create a simple yet
attractive file import section, similar to what you might find in an
`import_docs.html` file. This setup includes an input field for file uploads and
a styled button. Make sure you have Tailwind CSS included in your project. You
can do this by adding a CDN link in the `<head>
  ` section of your HTML file. ```html
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      <title>Import Documents</title>
      <link
        href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css"
        rel="stylesheet"
      />
    </head>
    <body class="bg-gray-100 flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
      <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 max-w-sm w-full">
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-center">Import Documents</h1>
        <form class="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <label
              for="file-upload"
              class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700"
              >Choose a file to upload:</label
            >
            <input
              type="file"
              id="file-upload"
              class="mt-1 block w-full text-sm text-gray-900 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg bg-gray-50 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500"
            />
          </div>
          <button
            type="submit"
            class="w-full bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white font-bold py-2 rounded-md"
          >
            Upload
          </button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>
  ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Tailwind CSS CDN**: The link to the Tailwind CSS CDN
  is included in the `
  <head>
    ` section to enable Tailwind’s utility classes. 2. **Styling**: The main
    body uses `bg-gray-100` for a light background, while the form container has
    a white background, rounded corners, and shadow for a card-like aesthetic.
    3. **Form Layout**: The form includes a file upload input and a button, both
    styled using Tailwind’s utility classes for padding, colors, and hover
    effects. 4. **Accessibility**: The input field is associated with a label
    for better accessibility. You can further customize the styles, sizes, or
    functionality as needed!
