Sure! Below is an HTML document that leverages Tailwind CSS to create a similar `<div>` component as described in your original example. This example includes a header and a paragraph and demonstrates how to use Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Tailwind CSS Example</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-100 flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">

    <div class="bg-blue-200 border-2 border-blue-500 rounded-lg shadow-md w-96 h-56 flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4 text-center">
        <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold">Hello!</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-700">This is a simple div element styled with Tailwind CSS.</p>
    </div>

</body>
</html>
```

### Description:
- This HTML document includes the Tailwind CSS CDN link for easy styling.
- The `<body>` utilizes Tailwind utility classes to center the content vertically and horizontally, set a light gray background, and ensure full height.
- The `<div>` has a light blue background with a blue border, rounded corners, and a shadow effect. It is also styled to be of fixed width and height.
- Inside the `<div>`, there is an `<h1>` element with bold text and a `<p>` element with gray-colored text that describes the content.

### Instructions:
1. Copy and paste this code into a text editor.
2. Save it with the `.html` extension (for example, `script_obs.html`).
3. Open the file in a web browser to see the styled component.
