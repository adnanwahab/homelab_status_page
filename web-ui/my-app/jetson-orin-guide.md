=====================================

### Overview

The Jetson Orin module supports multiple power modes to balance performance and power consumption. Understanding these power modes is essential for optimal use of the device, especially in resource-constrained environments.

### Available Power Modes

The Jetson Orin module supports four primary power modes:

#### 1. **Maximum Performance Mode** (Default)

*   Uses all available resources.
*   Ideal for applications requiring maximum performance and processing capabilities.
*   Consumes the highest amount of power among all modes.

#### 2. **Balanced Mode**

*   Optimizes a balance between performance and power consumption.
*   Suitable for most general-purpose computing tasks, including development and deployment scenarios where the full potential of the device is not required.
*   Consumes significantly less power than Maximum Performance Mode but more than other modes.

#### 3. **Low Power Mode**

*   Reduces system power to a lower consumption level.
*   Should be used for applications that are highly sensitive to power consumption or in situations where cooling capabilities might be limited, potentially leading to overheating issues.
*   May degrade performance depending on the application's requirements and thermal profile.

#### 4. **Sleep Mode**

*   Shuts down all system components except essential ones (like memory) to minimize power usage.
*   Ideal for temporary low-power operation during extended periods of inactivity, such as when an application is waiting for external stimuli or events.
*   This mode significantly reduces performance and is designed to save power at the expense of responsiveness.

### Power Mode Configuration

To switch between these modes, you can use `nvpmodel` from the command line. The utility allows you to change the operating point of the NVIDIA GPU on Jetson devices. Here are some examples:

#### Example 1: Switching to Balanced Mode

```bash
sudo nvpmodel -m 2
```

#### Example 2: Switching to Low Power Mode

```bash
sudo nvpmodel -m 3
```

#### Example 3: Switching to Sleep Mode

```bash
sudo nvpmodel -m 0
```

Remember, you need root privileges (`sudo`) to execute these commands.

### Thermal Management Considerations

The performance and power modes directly influence thermal management. When the system is under heavy load or running in a power mode that requires more processing resources than the current cooling solution can handle, it may lead to overheating issues. To mitigate this, consider the following strategies:
