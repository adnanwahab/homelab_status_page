facebook is cool. llama is one of my favroite things ever! 


llama is perhaps one of the most humane technologies on earth!!!! 


but, sometimes  instagram says people are fake when they are real :(


    i wish they just used a slightly more better bayesian spam filter - heres a diagram. 


    but besdies this one small issue, i think meta is one of the most undervalued companies on earth

    because peopel are what change the world, not technology. 


    i love llama :) 


    if you buy 3-4 used GPUS for 700 each - you can make 1 million in 90 days -- anyone can do it!!! 



    but if everyone does it , there will be notyhing left to do :( 


        one thing that can be infinite --- above software is hardware because -- -- chat bots can do anything - - except glue atoms together. 


people who work with their hands will be the last to be automated, in facct they never will be.
