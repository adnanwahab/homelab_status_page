This repo contains everything you need to build a super-cool robotics startup. ([shipfast](https://shipfa.st/) for robotics)
1. A react app for MMO-tele-operation + admin for ops, safety, understanding theory->practice.
2. A (react-native+livekit) app to code agents using on-device llm to gen correct prompts to auto-write infra+anything you want.
3. A deno server for server-side simulation, webgpu, and unity,unreal, nvidia omniverse integrations.
4. [sqlite+litestream for db](https://youtu.be/RqubKSF3wig?si=M6okGXrR_pyKB-8J) - + tailscale for connectivity + starlink for 5g in hard to reach places.

#hardware (componennts, sensors, 3d-printing, arms, locomotion)
1. jetson containers - setting up basics (jetson inital inistall, jupyter, segment-anythin-2, flux -> paint robot paint -> diffusion3d)
2. roomba
# hardware (wiring, debugging, i forget)

 thank kapil
 200 models from charlies almanack - refute all  society + while reconsutrcting a different possibly better way backed by dynamicland research - see al possiblities liek kairos without mania.

 200 biases - see at same time as models.


 Thanks to alan kay + worry dream + dynamicland.org + 
 thanks to kaparthy + 
 thats to will wright.
 thanks to valve and steam.
 thanks to nvidia. fbai, openai, x, etc.



GO, python,

Humor oct 17 - nov 1 

self driving - cat robot  - thank drew 

mmo-teleop - 10k people - issuing requests to cgi+llama+omniverse

200,000 - robotics depenedencies 
2025 - start biotech
2036 - govtech + neuralink.

pleiffer told you 3 things
1. learn cpp 
2. question -> 3 possibilie answers
3. quality of data = quality ai 
4. game mehanics for annotation (annotate games fro tool assisted speed runs to ) 
better world.
5. labeling is ininfite  -  image by andrew ng - 

-----

kai wang told me - 

--- 
jesse told me --- 


--- 
keheng told me -- think linear- appreciate self - learn dashboards - parlalelzize - (gdb)logging theory - 


-- paper party --- 


5. world building = fun games

2022 - wizards gave idea for robot universtiy  + every robots ' field' = datum of dynamic land - 
july 11 - karparthy annoucned LLM school - i love llm
oct 16 - 25% launch of robot.odyssey(mario+import to any school.)
