Seeing Space
Level 1: High-Level Overview
Shift from Construction to Understanding: Tools for modern projects (like robotics) need to focus on visualizing behavior instead of just building materials.
Seeing Spaces vs. Maker Spaces: Move beyond physical tools and create environments designed for real-time insight and experimentation.
Deep Exploration for Innovation: Providing tools for discovery and visualization leads to more profound learning, innovation, and scientific thinking.
Level 2: Main Themes and Ideas
The Need for Seeing Tools:
Traditional tools help with physical assembly, but creators also need tools to understand how their systems behave.
Visualization Beyond Screens:
Embed data collection everywhere and display information spatially, not just on small screens. Use the environment as part of the tool.
Experimentation and Time:
Tools should allow experimentation across multiple parameters, and systems should track and visualize changes over time.
Inspired by Control Rooms:
Similar to NASA control rooms, the space should allow makers to observe, rewind, and analyze every aspect of the project.
Level 3: Specific Actions and Implementation Ideas
Build a “Seeing Space” Prototype:
Create a modular robotics lab with real-time data displays projected onto walls and workbenches.
Use AR/VR for Visualization:
Integrate augmented reality or virtual reality for immersive exploration of robot behaviors.
Open-Source Tools for Experimentation:
Develop a software platform that automates parameter testing and collects all data in real-time for analysis.
Shift the Maker Space Philosophy:
Move from just teaching construction to fostering deep, scientific understanding through visualization and experimentation tools.
