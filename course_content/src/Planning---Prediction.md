Creating a visualization tool like Desmos in JavaScript can be complex, but I can help you get started with a basic example that illustrates how to visualize motion trajectories using an HTML canvas and JavaScript. Below is a simple implementation that assumes you want to visualize a projectile motion trajectory, which is a common topic in motion prediction.

This code does not explicitly read from a folder but assumes you're interested in a direct implementation that reflects the concept of motion trajectory prediction. If you want to read data from files, you could use AJAX requests or file input in a larger application.

Here's a simple implementation using HTML5 `<canvas>` to visualize a projectile motion:

### HTML Structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Motion Trajectory Prediction</title>
    <style>
        canvas {
            border: 1px solid black;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Motion Trajectory Prediction</h1>
    <canvas id="trajectoryCanvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>

    <script src="trajectory.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### JavaScript (trajectory.js)
```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('trajectoryCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Constants for motion
const g = 9.81; // Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)
const angle = 45; // Launch angle in degrees
const v0 = 50; // Initial velocity (m/s)

// Function to convert degrees to radians
function toRadians(degrees) {
    return degrees * (Math.PI / 180);
}

// Calculate the trajectory points
function calculateTrajectory() {
    const points = [];
    const rad = toRadians(angle);
    const totalTime = (2 * v0 * Math.sin(rad)) / g; // Total flight time
    const steps = 100; // number of points to calculate

    for (let t = 0; t <= totalTime; t += totalTime / steps) {
        const x = v0 * Math.cos(rad) * t;
        const y = v0 * Math.sin(rad) * t - 0.5 * g * t * t;
        points.push({ x: x * 10, y: canvas.height - (y * 10) }); // Scale for canvas size
    }
    return points;
}

// Draw the trajectory
function drawTrajectory(points) {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(points[0].x, points[0].y);
    for (let point of points) {
        ctx.lineTo(point.x, point.y);
    }
    ctx.strokeStyle = 'blue';
    ctx.lineWidth = 2;
    ctx.stroke();
}

// Main function to execute
function main() {
    const points = calculateTrajectory();
    drawTrajectory(points);
}

// Start the visualization
main();
```

### Explanation
1. **HTML Structure**: A simple HTML structure with a title and a canvas to render the trajectory.
2. **JavaScript Logic**: 
   - Includes a function to generate points along a projectile's trajectory based on initial velocity and angle.
   - `calculateTrajectory`: Calculates the trajectory points using basic physics equations for projectile motion.
   - `drawTrajectory`: Uses the HTML canvas API to draw the trajectory on the canvas.
   - The initial parameters (launch angle and velocity) can be modified to see different results.

### To Run the Code
1. Save the HTML and JavaScript in their respective files (`index.html` and `trajectory.js`).
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the motion trajectory visualization.

This example assumes you are looking to understand and visualize a basic motion trajectory. If you have a specific dataset or model in mind from the "Motion Trajectory Prediction" folder you mentioned, you could adapt this code to incorporate that data.Certainly! To visualize concepts related to "LLMs vs Classical Planning" using Three.js, we can create a simple diagram that distinguishes between these two topics. This example will illustrate two main concepts, using basic geometrical shapes like spheres or boxes, and connect them with lines to represent their relationship.

Hereâ€™s how you can get started with Three.js to create a rudimentary visualization.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Three.js included in your project. You can add it via a CDN:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
   ```

### Basic Structure

Here is a simple example code that sets up a Three.js scene to visualize the comparison between LLMs (Large Language Models) and Classical Planning.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>LLMs vs Classical Planning Visualization</title>
    <style>
        body { margin: 0; }
        canvas { display: block; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        // Scene setup
        const scene = new THREE.Scene();
        const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
        const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
        renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
        document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

        // LLMs Representation
        const llmsGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
        const llmsMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
        const llmsSphere = new THREE.Mesh(llmsGeometry, llmsMaterial);
        scene.add(llmsSphere);
        llmsSphere.position.x = -2;

        // Classical Planning Representation
        const cpGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
        const cpMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
        const cpCube = new THREE.Mesh(cpGeometry, cpMaterial);
        scene.add(cpCube);
        cpCube.position.x = 2;

        // Draw line connecting LLMs and Classical Planning
        const points = [];
        points.push(llmsSphere.position);
        points.push(cpCube.position);
        const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(points);
        const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffffff });
        const line = new THREE.Line(geometry, material);
        scene.add(line);

        // Camera position
        camera.position.z = 5;

        // Animation loop
        function animate() {
            requestAnimationFrame(animate);

            // Rotate the objects
            llmsSphere.rotation.y += 0.01;
            cpCube.rotation.y += 0.01;

            renderer.render(scene, camera);
        }

        animate();

        // Handle window resize
        window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
            const width = window.innerWidth;
            const height = window.innerHeight;
            renderer.setSize(width, height);
            camera.aspect = width / height;
            camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Key Parts

1. **Scene Setup**: We initialize the Three.js scene, camera, and renderer. The camera provides the perspective from which we observe our 3D objects.

2. **Geometries for LLMs and Classical Planning**:
   - We use a sphere to represent LLMs and a box to represent Classical Planning. 
   - Objects are colored differently for distinction (green for LLMs, red for Classical Planning).

3. **Connecting Line**: We create a line connecting the two objects to visualize their relationship.

4. **Animation Loop**: The `animate` function makes the objects slowly rotate to create a dynamic effect.

5. **Responsive Design**: The window resize event handler ensures that the visualization remains responsive to changing window sizes.

### Running the Code
You can copy the HTML code above into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to view the visualization. Make sure you have an internet connection so that Three.js can load from the CDN. 

This example provides a basic structure, and you can further enhance it by adding more details related to the content of "LLMs vs Classical Planning", customizing shapes, colors, and even adding more dimensions.
