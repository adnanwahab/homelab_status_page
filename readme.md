# Robotics-Odyssey.com - goal = Build lots dynamicland.org
Our goal is to make everyone's life 20% easier in 5 years by constructing a dynamicland in every neighborhood, because its like a computer but more fun to use and more augmentative.
# Why?? dynamicland.org = the coolest thing ever

## 1. Perception

## 2. Planning + Predciton

## 3. Simulation + UI
Unreal - shopping -> improve perception - computer vision
## 4. Hardware Design + Repair

## 5 Real World Applications (dynamical systems.)
1. cleaning your room
2. gardening -

1e14 = 100 trillion ->  (100 million) - (millionaires) - who can create at least 10 AI-Proof jobs that create the future - Artist-Scientist Wizards who use dynamicland.org - the best invention of all time. (zoox called me an inventor and gave me an inventor paper weight and a computer vision patent.)

odysseys purpose is to implment dynamicland.org's research into every neighborhood in the world, turning everyone into a millionaire artist scientist wizard in 5 years.
